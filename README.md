# A-call-center-with-limited-agents
The main goal of a call center is to reduce customer waiting time and make sure the agents are busy in a useful way. If customers wait too long, they may become unhappy. If agents are not busy, the company spends money without benefit.  In here, simulate a call center with a limited number of agents to see how well it performs.
